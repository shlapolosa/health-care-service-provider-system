clone the app;

> git clone https://github.com/shlapolosa/health-care-service-provider-system.git

> cd health-care-service-provider-system


To make Jhipster changes;

>docker image pull jhipster/jhipster

after getting the image, bind image to src directory

> docker container run --name jhipster -v {{path to root on local machine}}:/home/jhipster/app -v ~/.m2:/home/jhipster/.m2 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 -p 3001:3001 -d -t jhipster/jhipster

To check that your container is running, use the command docker container ps:

In case you update the Docker image (rebuild or pull from the Docker hub), itâ€™s better to remove the existing container, and run the container all over again. To do so, first stop the container, remove it and then run it again:

> docker container stop jhipster
> docker container rm jhipster
> docker image pull jhipster/jhipster
> docker container run --name jhipster -v ~/jhipster:/home/jhipster/app -v ~/.m2:/home/jhipster/.m2 -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 -p 3001:3001 -d -t jhipster/jhipster


Accessing the container

> docker container exec -it jhipster bash

And then you can run;

>jhipster import-jdl health-care-system.jh

You can then exit the container and run all commands on the command line.
> exit
> docker container stop jhipster
to build containers;

> mvn -Pprod verify com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:dockerBuild

to run everything;

>cd docker-compose
>docker-compose up -d
